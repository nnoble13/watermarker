fork and run!

Sick of stolen art and images? I am. I know there's not a lot stopping AI scraping to steal copyrighted work.
But I still want to be able to at least make it even just a little bit harder.

Here's a super simple app that overlays text over any image.

Features:
- dynamic text, adjusts to width of your image
- dynamic thickness
- dynamic transparency
- batch upload
- batch download

Future versions:
- resize and compress images
- watermark with image logo
- add noise (but <a href="https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/">Glaze</a> already exists so idk)


<table>
  <tr>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="images/myart.png" width="250"><br>
      <em>my original doodle</em>
    </td>
    <td align="center">
      <img src="images/myart_marked.png" width="250"><br>
      <em>watermarked</em>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
